# How to run

Get a copy of the runnable jar. Navigate to it using the command line. You must have your Java enviroment variable set up correctly.

The runnable jar requires 3 arguments

```cmd or gui``` 

and the location of the two files

```file1location filetwolocation```

The first file can be a link to a url that jsoup scrapes 

eg ```www.independent.ie stopwords.txt```

Below is an example 

Use the command

```java -jar WordCloud.jar cmd www.independent.ie C:Users\User\Desktop\stopfiles.txt```

If you have no files internal files will be used just pass arguments 

```java -jar WordCloud.jar gui 0 0```
